A Hyprland overview mode plugin.

The original repository was outdated and hard to update to current version of hyprland API
This is the reimplementation of it.
It has less features for now but a more stable and easy to scale codebase to maintain.

## Roadmap
  - dont resize actual windows, just scale the render buffers
  - add seceral new modes (overview workspace, overview monitor, overview all)
  - add workspaces in overview
  - restore some old features from the original repo
