A Hyprland overview mode plugin.

The original repository was outdated and hard to update to current version of hyprland API

Thus i rewrote it so it has less features but more stable and easy to scale and maintain.

Roadmap:
  - dont resize actual windows, just scale the render buffers
  - add seceral new modes (overview workspace, overview monitor, overview all)
  - add workspaces in overview
