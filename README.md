## hycov
A Hyprland overview mode plugin.

The [original repository](https://github.com/DreamMaoMao/hycov) was archived and hard to update to current version of hyprland API. <br>
This is the reimplementation of it. <br>
It has less features for now but a more stable and easy to scale codebase to maintain. <br>

## Roadmap
  - dont resize actual windows, just scale the render buffers
  - add seceral new modes (overview workspace, overview monitor, overview all)
  - add workspaces in overview
  - restore some old features from the original repo
